# Project Atomic Sparkle
_by David Black_

The goal of this project is to make a fun game. Make the game I want to play, get weird with it. Share it with people.
This is what my freetime as a software developer looks like. With a game I can get way weirder with it than
when I'm designing business software.

## Things to do

~~- Create a player~~
  ~~- Not necessarily a model though. Just a box  that moves~~
~~- Attach camera to player~~
  ~~- Give the camera controls~~
~~- Create a world/arena for the player to run around in~~
~~- Create a platform that the player can interact with~~
### Playable in XR
  This isn't a real need as much as it is something I want to do. I am having fun working on this even if it is uesless
  to the overall goal of the project.
- Floating observer mode
- Dialog needs to work in XRt
#### Arm Menu
- Need to find out how to do 3D menus
  - I think they will look cool, and they can translate between XR, mouse, and touch easily I think?
    - They should be controller friendly eventually though

### Inventory Menu
 - 3D grid based
   - Think Tetris/ Resident Evil 4.


## Things to do later

~~- Dialog, if any~~
-
